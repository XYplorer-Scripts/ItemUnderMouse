# ItemUnderMouse

**Demonstrates how to identify the list item in [XYplorer](http://xyplorer.com/index.php) pointed at by the mouse cursor.**

This script uses a compiled [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) script to retrieve information about the location and control underneath the mouse cursor and then uses this information to attempt to identify the list item at those coordinates.

As this script relies on a helper application, an undocumented scripting command within XYplorer, and does not have much practical use it should be considered a demonstration only.
